### Who I am

My name is Dave Laing.  I'm currently a Senior Functional Programmer at the Data61 FP Lab. 

I've been programming professionally since 2002, variously using Scala, Java, Python, x86 assembly and C++.
There was a PhD in Computer Science somewhere in the middle.

I'm also a co-organizer of [BFPG](http://www.bfpg.org), aka the Brisbane Functional Programming Group.
If you're in or visiting Brisbane and interested in functional programming, you should come along.

I'm very interested in functional programming, programming language theory, and various associated branches of mathematics.
I'm also a huge fan of Haskell.

Those are the kinds of things you're likely to see around here.

I'm always keen to have a chat about any interesting opportuntities that might be around.
