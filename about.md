### Who I am

My name is Dave Laing.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer for [Skedulo](http://skedulo.com/), writing Scala and Scalaz to keep the scheduling engine ticking over.

In the past I've done Java, Python and C++ as various places, and I've also done a Phd in Computer Science.

I'm very interested in functional programming, programming language theory, and various associated branches of mathematics.
I'm also a huge fan of Haskell.

Those are the kinds of things you're likely to see around here.
