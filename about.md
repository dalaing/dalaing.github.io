### Who I am

My name is Dave Laing.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer for [Skedulo](http://skedulo.com/), writing Scala and Scalaz to keep the scheduling engine ticking over,

I'm also a co-organizer of [BFPG](http://www.bfpg.org), aka the Brisbane Functional Programming Group.
If you're in or visiting Brisbane and interested in functional programming, you should come along.

In the past I've done Java, Python, x86 assembly and C++ at various places, and I've also done a Phd in Computer Science.

I'm very interested in functional programming, programming language theory, and various associated branches of mathematics.
I'm also a huge fan of Haskell.

Those are the kinds of things you're likely to see around here.
