<p>Welcome to my site.</p>

<p>This is intended partly as a landing page for various things that I've done or am doing, and partly as place for one-shot blog posts.</p>

<p>The hope is that most of the interesting stuff will be linked from the "Project and Series" tab at the top of the page.</p>

$for(posts)$
$partial("templates/post.html")$
$endfor$

$if(more)$
<a href="/archive.html">
 <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block">
     More
 </button>
</a>
$endif$
<br />
