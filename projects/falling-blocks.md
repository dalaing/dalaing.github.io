I've been meaning to play around with `sdl2` and `frpnow` for a while now, and so I've started work on a "falling blocks" game.

I've been blogging about it as I go.
I am trying to use it to demonstrate a handful of techniques and packages which I believe have a really good power-to-weight ratio, and am also going to be playing with some packages which are totally new to me as well.

More details are avaialable [here](http://dlaing.org/falling-blocks).
