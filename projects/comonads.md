I've recently given a talk on cofree comonads at YOW! Lambda Jam 2015, and there's a lot of material that I'm excited about and didn't have time to get into during the talk slot.

I've put [supporting materials](http://dlaing.org/cofun) online, including the slides, the associated code, and links for further reading.

I'll be adding blog posts there, covering both the contents of the talk and also various related bits and peices that I've had in my queue for a while.
