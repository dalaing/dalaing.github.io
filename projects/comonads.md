I've been accepted to give a talk on cofree comonads at YOW! Lambda Jam 2015, and there's a lot of material that I'm excited about and won't have time to get into during the talk slot.

Keep an eye on this space, because I'll be blogging about various interesting techniques, experiments and distractions related to comonads, comonad transformers and cofree comonads once I get the talk locked down.
