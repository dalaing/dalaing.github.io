I've been accepted to give a talk on cofree comonads at YOW! Lambda Jam 2015, and there's a lot of material that I'm excited about and won't have time to get into during the talk slot.

I'm putting some [supporting materials](http://dlaing.org/cofun) online, and I'll be adding some blog posts there about various related bits and peices that I've had in my queue for a while.
