        <p>I’m trying to generate ideas for community activities, so we can stay connected to each other, have some fun, and just generally be there for each other.</p>
<p>If you have more ideas to add to the list, let me know!</p>

<h2 id="boardgames">Boardgames</h2>
<p>There are websites that allow you to play boardgames online, for free.</p>
<p>Here are a few to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/join">Board Game Arena</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yucata.de/en/">Yucata</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some folks are also keen on <a href="https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/">Tabeltop Simulator</a>.</p>
<p>I have a recurring <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> call to help people to come together, find other people to play with, recommend various games to play etc…</p>
<p>At the moment I have the <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> call scheduled to go from 9 AM - midnight (Brisbane time, AKA UTC+10) on weekends, so that people can just drop in whenever and hang out:</p>
<ul>
<li>for those joining from a browser, the link is <a href="https://us04web.zoom.us/j/429711127?pwd=NE00SXI3Tlc3QzBqYzRLSmdjdnh6Zz09">https://us04web.zoom.us/j/429711127?pwd=NE00SXI3Tlc3QzBqYzRLSmdjdnh6Zz09</a></li>
<li>for those joining from the app, the Meeting ID is 429 711 127 and the Password is 767668</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that people will be dropping in and dropping out when they have time, so if you are keen to hang out with someone and noone else is currently in the room, maybe consider hanging around for a little while in case other people show up. I’ll try to drum up enough interest to keep things buzzing, but we’ll have to see how that goes.</p>
<p>While I’m around on the call I should be able to create breakout rooms for people who want to have side discussion etc… We’ll all work it out as we go.</p>
<h2 id="book-club">Book club</h2>
<p>The plan would be to read a chapter every couple of days, and to have a half hour call twice a week to discuss the chapter that we all read.</p>
<p>I’m considering setting this up for the following books, although I’m open to suggestions.</p>
<p>I’ll schedule the calls once we have 3 or more people interested and willing to chip away at these for a while.</p>
<h3 id="harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</h3>
<p>Available <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/">here</a> or in audiobook form <a href="http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56">here</a></p>
<p>Harry Potter fan-fiction, where Harry was raised on a healthy dose of the scientific method, science fiction and logic. The other characters all behave rationally as well, although they mostly don’t have Harry’s background.</p>
<p>This is probably not one to include the kids with, it has some more adult stuff in there.</p>
<h3 id="rationality-from-ai-to-zombies">Rationality: From AI to Zombies</h3>
<p>Available <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">here</a>.</p>
<p>For those who like their rationality with a non-fiction flavour. There is plenty to think about and discuss along the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/codex">The Codex</a> is shorter, lighter, and might be a bit more fun for a read along, but I think I’d like to try for a Rationality:A-Z group first.</p>
