A month or two ago, I started working for Data 61 as part of the [Queensland Functional Programming Lab](https://qfpl.io).

I'm pretty excited.
I'm getting to do functional programming, and it's all open source.

Part of the work involves working on educational materials like blog posts, talks and courses.
Part of the work involves writing code to fill gaps in some areas of the FP ecosystem, or to push things forward in areas that could use some help.
And it's all focused on doing things that will help programmers in industry.

I'm having a great time, but it will mean that I'll be doing most of my blogging from the QFPL blog.
You can see my various posts linked [my page on the blog](https://blog.qfpl.io/people/dlaing/).
If I work on something that isn't work-related, I'll do it here - but for now a lot of my interests are looking pretty well aligned with the goals of the lab.
