I've recently given a talk on cofree comonads at YOW! Lambda Jam 2015, and there's a lot of material that I'm excited about and didn't have time to get into during the talk slot.

I've put [supporting materials](http://dlaing.org/cofun) online.
I'll be adding blog posts there, covering both the contents of the talk and also various related bits and peices that I've had in my queue for a while.
