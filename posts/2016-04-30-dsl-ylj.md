I've just given a talk about domain specific languages and programming language theory at YOW! Lambda Jam 2016, which was planned as the kick-off point for a new blog series.

I'll be putting [supporting materials and blog posts](http://dlaing.org/little-languages) online as I complete them.
It should be a pretty wild ride, so hopefully you'll end up following along and enjoying the things I dig into.
