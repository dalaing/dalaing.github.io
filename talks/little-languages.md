I've been playing around with domain specific languages (DSLs), programming langauge theory (PLT), and some ideas around creating modular, testable tools in that area for a while, and I turned it into a YOW Lambda Jam talk recently.

I've put [supporting materials](http://dlaing.org/little-languages) online, including a series of blog posts.
