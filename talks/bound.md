I gave a talk on the `bound` library, which ended up going into lambda calculus as well.  It had some people scratching their heads, but hopefully in a good way.

The video is currently stuck in limbo, and I should probably track down the associated code and slides and put them in a repository somewhere.

A shorter, sharper version of this was embedded into the end of the "Little Languages" talk I did at YOW! Lambda Jam in 2016.
