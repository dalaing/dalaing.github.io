- add a page / set of entries for the reading list
  - split into read / reading / reading soon

- change to index-less urls (a la Yann)?

- generate a scheme to have posts / talks / projects with a leading underscore published in draft form?
  - no underscore -> talks
  - all -> _talks

- generate a feed from posts and talks and projects?

- configure hakyll to use deploy.sh?

- make the header more mobile friendly?

- look into an iframe for the header / menu
  - add drop downs in the header for posts
    - use submenus for year / month, badges for counts?
  - probably more useful for blog series
  - although affix / scrollspy might be better
